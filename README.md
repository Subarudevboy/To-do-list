# TaskFlow - Modern Todo Application

TaskFlow is a beautifully designed, fully responsive todo application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It combines modern UI principles with practical functionality to help you organize your tasks efficiently. The app features a clean, minimalistic design with smooth animations, dark/light mode support, and persistent local storage to keep your tasks safe across browser sessions.

## Quick Start

You can start using TaskFlow immediately by opening the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No installation, build process, or server setup required.

To get started locally, clone this repository and open the main file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Subarudevboy/To-do-list.git
cd To-do-list
open index.html
```

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your preferred location.

## How to Use TaskFlow

TaskFlow is designed to be intuitive from the moment you open it. Type your task in the input field and press Enter or click "Add Task" to create a new item. Click the checkbox next to any task to mark it as complete, and use the delete button (Ã—) that appears when you hover over a task to remove it entirely.

The app provides three filter options to help you focus on what matters: "All" shows every task, "Active" displays only incomplete items, and "Completed" shows finished tasks. You can quickly clear all completed tasks using the "Clear Completed" button, which is particularly useful for maintaining a clean workspace.

Your tasks are automatically saved to your browser's local storage, so they'll persist even after closing and reopening the application. The statistics section at the top shows your total tasks, completed count, and active items at a glance.

## Core Features

TaskFlow includes everything you need for effective task management. The application automatically saves your tasks locally, ensuring your data persists across browser sessions without requiring any external services or accounts.

The responsive design adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal experience whether you're using a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone. The interface includes smooth hover effects, subtle animations, and a professional color scheme that's easy on the eyes.

You can switch between light and dark themes using the toggle button in the header. Your theme preference is remembered and applied automatically when you return to the app. The dark mode uses carefully selected colors that reduce eye strain during extended use.

The filtering system helps you focus on specific types of tasks, while the real-time statistics keep you informed about your progress. Task completion includes satisfying visual feedback with checkmark animations, and deleting tasks triggers smooth slide-out effects.

Keyboard shortcuts enhance productivity: press Ctrl+/ (or Cmd+/ on Mac) to quickly focus the input field, and use Ctrl+Shift+C (or Cmd+Shift+C on Mac) to clear all completed tasks instantly.

## Development Setup

TaskFlow is built with vanilla web technologies, making it straightforward to modify and extend. The entire application consists of a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript, which keeps the project simple while maintaining full functionality.

To set up a development environment, you'll need a modern web browser and a text editor or IDE of your choice. We recommend using Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension for automatic browser refresh during development.

If you prefer working with separate files, you can extract the CSS and JavaScript into their own files. Create a `styles.css` file for the CSS content and a `script.js` file for the JavaScript, then update the HTML file to reference these external files using standard link and script tags.

The application uses CSS custom properties (variables) for theming, making it easy to customize colors and spacing. The JavaScript is organized as a single class with clear method separation, allowing you to easily understand and modify specific functionality.

For testing across different devices and browsers, we recommend using browser developer tools to simulate various screen sizes and ensuring compatibility with modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

## Contributing to TaskFlow

We welcome contributions that improve TaskFlow's functionality, design, or user experience. Before making significant changes, please open an issue to discuss your proposed modifications with the community.

When contributing code, please maintain the existing code style and structure. The project prioritizes readability and simplicity, so new features should integrate seamlessly with the current design patterns. Test your changes across different browsers and screen sizes to ensure compatibility.

If you're adding new features, consider how they fit with the app's minimalist philosophy. TaskFlow aims to be powerful yet simple, so new functionality should enhance rather than complicate the user experience.

Documentation improvements are always appreciated, whether you're fixing typos, clarifying instructions, or adding examples. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue with a clear description of the problem or enhancement request.

To contribute code, fork the repository, create a feature branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request with a clear description of what you've modified and why.

## Browser Compatibility

TaskFlow works in all modern browsers that support ES6 features, CSS Grid, and Flexbox. This includes recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. The app uses standard web APIs like localStorage and does not require any polyfills for supported browsers.

For the best experience, we recommend using the latest version of your preferred browser. Older browsers may experience reduced functionality or visual inconsistencies.
